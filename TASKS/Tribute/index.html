        Eren Yeager was a former member of the Survey Corps. He was the main protagonist of Attack on Titan. He lived in Shiganshina District with his parents until the fall of Wall Maria, where he impotently witnessed his mother being eaten by a Titan.
         This event would lead to Eren's intense hatred towards the Titans as he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the Earth.

    <p>As part of the Attack Titan's unique ability, Eren could reveal his own memories to his predecessors, giving them insight into the future. 
        He gave memories of the future to his father Grisha, selecting the ones that would suit his purpose. 
        By doing so, he indirectly gave his younger self insight into his own future via Grisha's memories when Eren kissed Historia's hand.</p>
